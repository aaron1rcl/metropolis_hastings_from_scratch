MCMC Metropolis Hastings and Bayesian Regression from Scratch

This repository contains a notebook showing how to do Bayesian regression from scratch. I haven't used any major libraries so you can see the inner workings of an MCMC algorithm.

This repo is meant for demonstration and learning only, if you want to do proper Bayesian regression use a fully fledged library.
